## deepTS
- deepTS is a powerful and flexible web-based Galaxy platform for identifying, visualizing and analyzing transcriptional switch events from pairwise, temporal and population transcriptome data.

- deepTS consists of three main functional modules, covering the processes of read cleaning and mapping; transcriptome map construction; expression abundance estimation; multiple-condition TS analysis pipelines, multiple-level TS characterization, and multiple-form visualization to allow users to perform TS analysis using either raw RNA-Seq data or expression abundance matrices directly.

- deepTS project is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/cma2015/deepTS). A demo server is available at http://www.omicstudio.cloud:4009/. We suggest users to run deepTS locally using the Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/deepts).
